us int altgr no deadkey keyboard layout 

Finally I found a useful keyboard layout for OSX. A US-English layout with the alt+gr additions that allows me to type äåßüö without finger acrobatic. 
The us-int-altgr-nodeadkey layout, as I am used to use it since ever.

The keyboard layout comes from here:

It can be changed/edited with ukelele
